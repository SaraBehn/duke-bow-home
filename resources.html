			 <strong><p>Other tips</p></strong>
         <ul>
            <li>Create a few research reports in different industries. Create a 2-4 page write-up on a stock you like with an investment thesis, supporting facts, research and valuation models (comps and DCF and financial sattement projections). They should look pretty! Putting in the effort to create these write-ups shows an interest.</li>
			<li>You will be asked for a stock pitch, which is why doing those write-ups helps. Practice a 1 minute stock pitch until you have it down. Have a few in mind, in various industries, because you don't have to pitch a stock to an ER that actually covers that stock</li>
			<li>Same as S&T, keep a market journal to stay on top of the news, even just main headlines/articles and most importantly your view</li>
